I want to learn how to use nodejs, so I'm working on a project to do that. This project quickly turned into a personal contest to see how many free SaaS services I could tie the app too.

## SaaS services used
- Heroku for hosting
- Loggly for loggin'
- Stormpath for authc/z
- Mailgun - I'm using this to get my bro photos posted to the site.

### Instructions for configuring said SaaS services for free.
TBD Duh

## Make a dev build
I'll get back to you on this.

## testing
Are you fucking serious, I don't test my code.

# final thoughts
I'm not sure how much of this is a giant troll or a conceded effort to not be an old dude who knows nuthin about the new fangled internet cloud. I'll be here all week folks.
